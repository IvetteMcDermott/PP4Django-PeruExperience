# Design

The idea had been present the information in a old polaroid style using cards from bootstrap. Using colours that represent the culture for the details and small amounts of ancient textiles from the culture of each region to give character to them.

## Color Scheme

The colors in the app had been inspired by a palette based in ancient cultures from [icolorpalette](https://icolorpalette.com/peru-and-peru). They had been used for the font and details as when seen in the bigger portions they were too strong and the idea of the cards on the polaroid style did not work nicely with.

## Font

The font selected is Raleway, which I think it complements the used ones in the logo and style.
