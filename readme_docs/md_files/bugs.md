### Place details
An error is present in the last report. Small changes were done to adjust to the standards but this one is generated in the crispy form and by CkEditor, it adds tags when saved and when the updating form brings the item back the tags overlap as a picture show. Other minor similar errors had been fixed but this one as it is inside the form, so far have not found a way to solve. And being that it is part of the CRUD functionality for comments, have left it for the moment until a fix is found.

This page had been created for to give access to the user to find a specific place of their interest. It had suffered some changes in the proccess as there was some conflict with a type of search by location that was included and the validator would not accept it. So I decided to drop it, and keep in the research to in the future reinstall it.
