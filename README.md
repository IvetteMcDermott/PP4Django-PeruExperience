# About

This site had been created thinking of providing information in a more personal way about Peruvian touristic attractions and experiencing them. At this stage the information that the site displays had been taken from Wikipedia as it is mentioned in the credits. 
It has a search engine by name that allows the users to find a specific place of interest. 
It has different levels of features according to the type of user that accesses the site. For the registed users for example, there is a pin icon that allows them to use the interests option that permits them to bookmark and keep them for future visits. It also opens the option to create a profile and get in touch with the app community. The community functionality is one to be developed in the future.

# UX
